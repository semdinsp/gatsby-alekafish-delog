## Coral Table/Inventory

We have started building our first coral tables this week (see the picture above).  These are being built in Dili and will be transported later to our site in Atabae in a month or two once the covid travel restrictions are removed.  The table size is roughly 0.8m wide  by 1.8m long with a grid made of rebar.  This steel based construction should be reasonably environmentally friendly and shall not contribute to microplastic buildup in our oceans.

We will build up to ten tables and then source coral seedlings with assistance from appropriate  local resources.  We want to have  inventory on site in Atabae and technical capacity within our team when we are ready to aggressively grow.

It is likely we will start to produce tables locally in Atabae once we hire  local resources in Atabae and can transfer knowledge to the team.
