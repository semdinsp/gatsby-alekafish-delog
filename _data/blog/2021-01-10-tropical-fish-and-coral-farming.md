## Coral Permaculture

Our plan is to seed coral tables from a few natural corals (typically seeds are taken from wave damaged coral which would normally perish) and then use the seeded coral to "farm" coral.  We call it permaculture as once we seed the table we do not need to revisit the reef ever again..  In theory there is minimal environmental impact from this activity and our coral tables act as natural reefs to attract fish.

We plan to upload some photos of our first ten coral tables shortly.  We will use this link to track progress. 

In addition, we shall develop procedures where we reseed natural reefs with our generated coral.
