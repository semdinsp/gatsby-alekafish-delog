## Operations Site

Our operations site will be at Atabae where we will build a facility for staff to work and for storage of coral/tropical fish prior to transport. The photograph shows the beach as it stands.  We will build a small structure for processing.  Once the plans are finalized they will be  add to the website.

We have done an initial paper based survey of this location and the feedback was:

1. Location looks fair to good based on open water exposure
2. Ocean current appears to be flowing from SW to NE which should reduce impact from land pollution.  The coastline's bend on northern side should help to keep water surface temperatures lower.
3. Further surveys are suggested to fully understand the area's potential.

### Proposed site survey 

We envision using the following advanced marine technology  techniques for our site survey.

#### Towed Survey
