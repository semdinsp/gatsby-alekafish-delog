## First Coral Table

We have deployed our first coral table near Pertamina Terminal for testing purposes.  We plan to expand to our first location (Atabae) sometime this month and hope to deploy 10 tables.

This is a simple rebar coral table installed with concrete.  We need to make some revisions on our process to improve viability of the coral but it is a great start
