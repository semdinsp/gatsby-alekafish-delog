## Coral Tracking

Part of our service will be end to end coral tracking so you can prove that the coral comes from a properly farmed location and has not be unauthorized.  We will provide QR codes and micro chips embedded with identity tracking.  These can be tracked for regulatory and environmental protection.  We hope to announce and demonstrate an interesting technical solution prior to Aug 2021.

Our aim is to have a completely  sustainable and environmentally friendly business providing local employment in Timor Leste and show casing the opportunities of this beautiful country.
